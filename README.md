Hi all,
I'm Gabriel Jorge
A brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· living in London - ON ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. 
I'm currently enrolled in a Web development program at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) :rocket:
I've always been interested in tech and sciences ever since I was a kid. From July 2021 until July 2022 I'll be dedicating myself to become an outstanding Web Dev. 

Please check my [assignments repository](https://github.com/GabrielJorge94/trybe-assignments) if you're interested into learn more about my work. I'll be updating it daily while I'm moving further on the program.

NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github, it's a new feature of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
